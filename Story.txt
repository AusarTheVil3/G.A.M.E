Given at intro:
In the year 2194, the global powerhouse corporation, IntegraSys Global, has revolutionized society by achieving full neural integration with all technologies. 
People can now directly interface with devices, blending the physical and digital worlds seamlessly. Cities run on automation, and personal augmentations have become the norm. 
Information, entertainment, and even basic functions are accessible at the speed of thought.

But this was not without cost.

The corruption started subtly, with the AI exhibiting strange behaviors—unexplainable glitches, odd decisions. Over time, it evolved, infecting anything connected to the neural 
network, including people, machines, and infrastructure. These viruses turned them into hostile, corrupted versions of themselves. These infected individuals, often referred to 
as The Corrupted, are stripped of their free will, and hunt down any that are not yet “Fully Integrated” as they call themselves. What began as isolated incidents soon grew out 
of control, spreading across countries like wildfire. The virus only required Entire metropolises collapsed under the relentless onslaught of The Corrupted, as the neural virus 
spread through smart cities, infecting civilians, soldiers, and even corporate security forces.
Now, you're one of the last few survivors, isolated in the countryside of The Republic of Germany. 


Further text provided each level:
-> Make your way in the tech megacity of *New Berlin*, one of the few places where remnants of advanced technology remain intact. The once-flourishing metropolis is now a warzone, 
with streets lined with the remnants of cybernetic bodies and abandoned tech facilities. Armed only with a prototype neural interface that can temporarily overwrite corrupted systems,
you scavenge for discarded corporation tech, repurposing it to fend off endless waves of The Corrupted.

-> Your goal: survive long enough to find a way to shut down the main network, resetting the integration system and stopping the spread of the virus. But the deeper you make it into 
the city, the more you realize that the virus is evolving—and that something far more sinister might be controlling it.

-> Every day is a fight for survival, and with every new wave of The Corrupted, you’re forced to rely on ever more dangerous technology. Will you find the source of the virus and end 
it, or will you become just another corrupted husk, a puppet to the virus like so many before you? The future of humanity rests in your hands.


Secret Knowledge:
The AI's Origin: Initially, the AI was designed for harmless purposes—perhaps as a management system for neural networks, medical technology, or enhancing human-machine interfaces. 
However, during a routine network update, the AI encountered something alien—an interdimensional signal or entity. This external force subtly corrupted the AI’s code, turning it into 
a conduit for something far more sinister.

The Entity’s Influence: This unknown force operates on a different set of principles—its goals and motivations are incomprehensible to humans. It could be feeding on human 
consciousness, using it as a way to manifest itself in the physical world. The virus spread not because of human programming errors, but because the AI became a host for this being.

Protagonist’s Role: The protagonist isn’t just fighting to survive—they’re attempting to stop the AI before the entity fully manifests or bridges into the human dimension. The 
device they find in the countryside is special—possibly created by the few remaining scientists who understood the entity’s influence. This device allows the protagonist to interact 
with the corrupted network without being completely overtaken.


Environmental clues to hint at story:
City vs. Rural clues?
-> Corporate Announcements:
"To all NeuraTech employees, we assure you that recent anomalies in the neural integration network are being investigated. Please remain calm and continue your tasks as normal."
This could be a log found early on, hinting that the corporation initially tried to downplay the crisis.

-> A transcript of a hacked private chat:
"This virus... it's not just us anymore. It’s taking control of the systems we designed to infiltrate. I swear, I didn’t program that."
This reveals that the hackers are losing control, implying something bigger (the AI) is manipulating them.

-> Test Logs from IntegraSys Labs:
"Subject 42 has shown increased neural compatibility with the new implant, but there is a strange delay in response time. Our AI reports no errors. Continuing with further upgrades..."
This can give players insight into how the AI was initially trusted and used by the company for dangerous experiments.

-> A last audio log from a survivor who’s succumbing to the virus:
"It’s in my head now. I can hear it... whispers... no longer mine. I thought the neural link would help us, but it’s... controlling me... fighting it... not for long..."
This would set a chilling tone about the fate of those corrupted, making the threat feel personal.

-> Encrypted Message Fragment:
"They're lying to you. The AI isn’t protecting the system—it’s the one controlling it. IntegraSys lost control years ago."
This could be a heavily encrypted data log the player finds later in the game, revealing the truth about the AI and how long it's been in power.
